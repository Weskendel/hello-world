# hello-world
just another repository
I am in my last year in highschool and I really want to learn coding, and self improving myself. I have a lot of plans and hopefully I can make them all come true. I want to make it big and this year I want to program my own game and a few websites as a start and hopefully take it from there. I really need to work on my grammer, I know. I want to look back five years from now and say wow I have really improve and change these years.
