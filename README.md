# hello-world
just another repository.
I am in my last year in highschool and I really want to learn coding, and improving myself. I have a lot of plans and hopefully I can make them all come true. I want to make it big and by the end of this year I want to program my own game and a few websites as a start. I'll see how it goes and take it from there. I really need to work on my grammer, I know. I want to look back five years from now and say wow I have really improved and changed these past few years.
